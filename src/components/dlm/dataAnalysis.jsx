            By leveraging UCIT tools, we have the capacity to perform large-scale
            analytics projects from administrative, EMR, sensor data, and more. Whether it
            concerns public data or subject and person sensitive information, the academic
            infrastructure used for transporting, analyzing, storing, and disseminating
            your data have been architected and approved to handle data at all levels of
            confidentiality. When analyses are performed on high performance nodes and
            hosted instances within the universityâ€™s computation network, data stays on
            the premises and never travels beyond the security perimeters. Data and
            generated (meta) data gets wiped after specific project purposes have been
            fulfilled.
