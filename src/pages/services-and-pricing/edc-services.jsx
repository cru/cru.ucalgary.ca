              <u>Self-service projects:</u> Research teams experienced in REDCap can
              complete the build and setup themselves. The CRU provides users with access
              to REDCap and maintains the REDCap platform, such as updates/patches, data
              backups, and system administration.
            </li>
            <li>
              <u>CRU supported projects:</u> We have specialized expertise in REDCap
              database development and are happy to complete an end-to-end project build
              for research studies. This is ideal for research teams who are new to
              REDCap, studies that need advanced or complex features, or who want a
              convenient full service option.
            </li>
